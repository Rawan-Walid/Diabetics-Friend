# Diabetics-Friend
Doctors always ask diabetes patients to bring a record of their sugar levels of the month to analyze but in the tight life schedule we rarely or never do that . So we thought what if we make something that will be super easy to record details about sugar levels and related stuff and present as a weekly or monthly report !

What it does 

It is going to be a SUPER FUN AND EASY WAY to check on our diabetes ! 

A virtual assistant is here to listen to you ! You just have to say the daily details . It will listen to you and make you a perfect analysis of your updates.
1. You can upload your daily sugar level 
2. You can set a target sugar level ! So everytime you upload the daily sugar level you will be reminded of your target !!! 
3. Our assistant will suggest you whatâ€™s better to eat today and help with your diet planning ! 
4. You will get the well analyzed report of your sugar levels to show to the doctor and get more accurate diagnosis

Diabetes is always so confusing ! There are 2 types and in each type there are complications for each person ! With your well analyzed report , you will get a very personalized diagnosis

Here is a demo on our virtual friend feel free to try it out
